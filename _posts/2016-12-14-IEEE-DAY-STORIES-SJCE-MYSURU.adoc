= IEEE DAY STORIES | SJCE, MYSURU

We, the Compute team sent mails to many SBs for IEEE Day stories. We were amazed to receive a mail from IEEE SJCE Mysuru with nothing more than a link to a video. We first didn't consider the mail for posting in blog as we were looking for reports. But once we saw the video, we wanted to share it to all volunteers.

We are quoting a part of the email here:
"In connection with IEEE DAY 2016 celebrations we made a short movie along the lines of the theme "Leveraging Technology For Humanity ". The short movie is based on the reality of the effective use of technology in everyday activities by the IEEE-SJCE team. IEEE-SJCE strives to make the best use of the technology and continues to inspire and motivate the students."

Team IEEE Compute lauds each and every person behind the creation of this video and thanks to *SURAJ REVANKAR*, Vice chairman, IEEE-SJCE ,Mysuru for sharing this video with us.
