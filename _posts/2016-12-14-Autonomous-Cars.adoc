I remember the time when I used to read the Batman Comics, with my mouth gaping open in awe at the stunts Batman pulled off with his Batmobile. How at the press of a button, the car would leave his home on its own and reach his location never failed to fascinate me. Like me, Iâ€™m sure many others must have fantasized seeing driverless cars on roads. These dreams might have seemed too good to be true as it was always overshadowed by skepticism about its feasibility in our lifetime. Thanks to Google, our doubts can now be dismissed without a second thought.
